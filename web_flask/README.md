# web_flask - AirBnB Clone v2

This directory contains Flask-based web routes for the **AirBnB Clone v2** project. It is a part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum and serves as an introduction to using Flask as a backend framework for serving dynamic content.

## Description

The `web_flask` directory includes Python scripts that:

- Set up a basic Flask web server
- Handle specific URL routes (e.g., `/`, `/hbnb`)
- Return custom HTML content
- Prepare the backend for integration with templates and databases (in later tasks)
